  <h1>📱 JSSCollab</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>JSSCollab</strong> is your all-in-one companion app designed to make student life more affordable, 
    organized, and collaborative. Whether you’re dealing with online orders, exchanging study materials, 
    splitting premium subscriptions, or traveling together, JSSCollab helps you save money, reduce effort, 
    and connect with your peers at JSS.
  </p>

  <h2>🚀 Why JSSCollab?</h2>
  <p>
    Student life is full of small but constant challenges — expensive delivery charges, high transport fares, 
    or even the yearly hassle of exchanging quantum books. Individually, these might feel minor, but collectively 
    they add up to a lot of time, energy, and money. JSSCollab is built to solve these problems in a smart, 
    collaborative way by pooling resources and creating opportunities for students to support each other.
  </p>

  <h2>✨ Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🛒 <strong>Co-Order with Neighbors:</strong> 
      Join forces with nearby students to place a single large order online. 
      This way, you don’t need to spend extra just to meet the minimum free delivery threshold. 
      More savings, fewer delivery charges.</li>

   <li>📚 <strong>Exchange Quantums:</strong> 
      Quantum books are essential, but buying them new every semester is costly and wasteful. 
      With JSSCollab, you can connect with students who want to swap books at the end of the term. 
      This ensures everyone has the latest study material without unnecessary expenses.</li>

  <li>💳 <strong>Group Plan Purchases:</strong> 
      Many premium apps and services (like OTT platforms, cloud storage, or productivity tools) 
      offer multi-user plans. JSSCollab helps you find peers to share these subscriptions with, 
      so the cost per person is drastically reduced.</li>
    <li>🚕 <strong>Shared Cab Rides:</strong> 
      Heading to the railway station, bus terminal, or any popular location? 
      Use JSSCollab to share cabs with other students. This reduces travel costs 
      while also making the ride more enjoyable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧑‍🎓 Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pooling a food delivery order from Swiggy/Zomato with hostel mates.</li>
    <li>Swapping a 3rd-year Quantum for a fresh 2nd-year one at the semester break.</li>
    <li>Splitting a Netflix or Spotify Family subscription between 5 friends.</li>
    <li>Sharing an Ola/Uber ride to the station before semester break vacations.</li>
